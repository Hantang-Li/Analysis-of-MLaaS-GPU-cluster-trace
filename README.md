# Analysis-of-MLaaS-GPU-cluster-trace

In this project, we will apply data analysis, data visualization and machine learning techniques to understand the GPU cluster from a data perspective. We will evaluate the GPU sharing infrastructure’s performance and evaluate the system’s fairness, and provide possible suggestions to improve the system.
